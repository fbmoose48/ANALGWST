NAME
       seminf - An analytical solution for one-dimensional ground-water
                solute transport in a semi-infinite system with uniform
                flow

ABSTRACT
       The program SEMINF computes the analytical solution to the one-
       dimensional solute-transport equation for a semi-infinite system
       with a first-type or third-type boundary condition at the inflow
       end.

METHOD
       The computer program calculates the concentration for the one-
       dimensional system based on the equation given in Wexler (1992a, p.
       21). The concentration can be calculated for different times and
       spatial locations.

HISTORY
       Version 1.1 1996/04/03 - Code restructuring and clean up: use of
          consistent spacing; use of upper and lower case variable names;
          statement labels renumbered; comment statements altered to be
          consistent; use of Hollerinth data in FORMAT statements removed;
          all variables and routines declared; duplicate code placed in new
          routines; interactive prompting for graphics output devices
          added.  Bug fixed in contour routine related to contours at the
          left edge of the plot.

       Version 1.0 1990/04/03 - Initial published version.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
       The program requires data on advective velocity, dispersion
       coefficient, spatial information, temporal information, and boundary
       concentrations.  Optional data may include a first-order solute-
       decay coefficient.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       Output is the calculated concentrations at specified points in time
       and space. A plotting option exists to view the output as graphs.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       pgm_name is written in Fortran 77 with the following extensions:
       use of include files and reference to compiler-dependent system date
       and time routines.  Graphics are coded using Computer Associates'
       DISSPLA library references.  Generally, the program is easily
       installed on most computer systems that have access to the DISSPLA
       graphics library.  Alternatively, graphics can be disabled and data
       can be easily extracted from the program output and plotted using
       graphic presentation programs.  The code has been used on UNIX-based
       computers.
