and information files) are currently available for UNIX systems:

  analgwst.1.DGUX.tar.gz    - Compiled for Data General AViiON under DG/UX 5.4
  analgwst.1.Solaris.tar.gz - Compiled for Sun UltraSPARC 2 under Solaris 2.5
  analgwst.1.source.tar.gz  - Source code

dimensional solute-transport equation for a finite system with a
first-type or third-type boundary condition at the inflow end.

The program GAUSS computes the analytical solution to the two-
dimensional solute-transport equation for an infinite-width system
with a solute source having a gaussian concentration distribution.

The program PATCHF computes the analytical solution to the three-
dimensional solute-transport equation for a finite-width and finite-
height system with a finite-width and finite-height solute source.

The program PATCHI computes the analytical solution to the three-
dimensional solute-transport equation for an infinite-width and
infinite-height system with a finite-width and finite-height solute
source.

The program POINT2 computes the analytical solution to the two-
dimensional solute-transport equation for an infinite system with a
continuous point source.

The program POINT3 computes the analytical solution to the three-
dimensional solute-transport equation for an infinite system with a
continuous point solute source.

The program POINT3_MOD is a modification of the POINT3 program that 
computes the analytical solution to the three-dimensional solute-transport
equation for an infinite system with a continuous point solute source.

The program SEMINF computes the analytical solution to the one-
dimensional solute-transport equation for a semi-infinite system

The program STRIPI computes the analytical solution to the two-
dimensional solute-transport equation for an infinite-width system
with a finite-width solute source.


C. MODIFICATIONS

The program has been modified from the published code.  The modifications
involved code restructuring and clean up.  The clean up involved use of
consistent spacing, use of upper and lower case variable names, statement
labels are renumbered, comment statements are altered to be consistent,
use of Hollerinth data in FORMAT statements removed, all variables and
routines are declared, duplicate code placed in new routines.  Interactive
prompting for graphics output devices is added.  Bug fixed in contour
routine related to contours at the left edge of the plot.


D. EXTRACTING FILES

The compressed tar file, named analgwst.1.OS.tar.gz, contains all the files
needed to install and test ANALGWST on a computer with a particular operating
system, where OS is a string indicating the operating system the distribution
is intended for.  If a version is not available for your operating system, the
file analgwst.1.source.tar.gz contains the source code and all other files
needed to compile, install, and test the software on a UNIX-based computer.
For either type of distribution, the directory analgwst.1 is created (or
overwritten) when the files are extracted from the tar file.  If the analgwst.1
directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it before
extracting the files.  The following are the steps to extract the files
from a distribution tar file.

   1. If the tar file is not already in the directory under which you want
      the distribution installed, move it there.  For example:
         mv analgwst.1.____.tar.gz /usr/opt/wrdapp

   2. If you are not in the directory where the tar file is located, go
      there.  For example:
         cd /usr/opt/wrdapp

   3. Uncompress the distribution file.  For example:
         gunzip analgwst.1.____.tar.gz

   4. Extract the distribution files from the tar file.  For example:
         tar -xpof analgwst.1.___.tar

      This creates the following directory structure (the contents of each
      directory are shown to the right):

      analgwst.1         ; copy of this README file
        `-----bin        ; compiled executables
        `-----bin_data   ; data file required by GAUSS, PATCHI, POINT2, STRIPI
        `-----doc        ; documentation files 
        `-----src        ; Makefile and source code
        `-----test       ; scripts to run verification tests
        `-----data       ; standard data sets used in verification tests

Notes:
a) The bin directory is not included in the analgwst.1.source.tar.gz
   distribution (it is created during compilation).
b) Source code is included only with the analgwst.1.source.tar.gz
   distribution.
c) It is recommended that no user files be kept in the analgwst.1 directory
   structure.  If you do plan to put files in the analgwst.1 directory
   structure, do so only by creating subdirectories of analgwst.1.


E. COMPILING

If a compiled version of the software is not available for your computer, or
if you want to build the executables yourself, follow the instructions in this
section.  If you have retrieved a pre-compiled distribution of the software,
skip to the Installing section below.

The source code is provided in the analgwst.1.source.tar.gz distribution so
that users can generate the executables themselves.  No support can be
provided for users generating their own versions of the software.  In general,
the requirements are a Fortran compiler, DISSPLA graphics library, and a
minimal level of knowledge of the compiler and the UNIX operating system.
As provided, the Makefile and source code are set up for use on Data General
AViiON workstations running the DG/UX operating system.

To generate new executables, do the following:

   1. Change directory to the source directory:
         cd analgwst.1/src

   2. Modify the beginning of the file named Makefile to correctly specify 
      system-dependent variables:
        
         GraphLib     Graphics library pathname
         F77          Fortran compiler name
         FFLAGS       Fortran compiler flags
         OS           Operating system name
    
   3. Use the make program to initiate compilation of the source code and
      installation of the software:
         make [BINDIR=directory_for_links]

      See the Installing instructions below for an explanation of BINDIR.

      The make will:
         a. create the directories analgwst.1/bin and BINDIR if they do not
            already exist,
         b. compile the source code,
         c. place the executables (seminf, finite, point2.exe, stripf,
            stripi.exe, gauss.exe, point3, patchf, patchi, point3_mod) in
            analgwst.1/bin, and
         d. place a link to the executables in BINDIR if specified.


F. INSTALLING

To make the executables (seminf, finite, point2.exe, stripf, stripi.exe, 
gauss.exe, point3, patchf, patchi, point3_mod) easy to use, it should be
installed in a directory included in the user's search path.  The Makefile
(input instructions to the UNIX make program--located in analgwst.1/src)
contains instructions to optionally place a link in a specified directory to
the executables contained in analgwst.1/bin.  Use the following two commands
to do this:

       cd analgwst.1/src
       make install [BINDIR=directory_for_links]

If BINDIR is specified, a link to each executable is placed in the specified
directory.  For example, if your search path consists of:
       /usr/bin:/usr/opt/bin:/usr/local/bin
use the command:
       make install BINDIR=/usr/local/bin
to make the executables accessible from any directory without requiring the full
pathname of the software's location.

Notes:
a) Brackets "[xxx]" are used to indicate optional arguments to commands.
b) To create and delete a link to the ANALGWST executable files, the installer
   must have sufficient rights in the directory that BINDIR is set to.


G. RUNNING THE SOFTWARE

ANALGWST prompts for the input and output file names.  If plotting is selected,
the programs prompt for the graphics device (X11 display, PostScript, Meta file,
TAB 132/15 graphics display, or Tektronix 4114 graphics display).  If PostScript
is selected, the program prompts for the file name for this output.  Note that
the DISSPLA graphics requires the specified file not exist prior to execution.
The last prompt requests the color to use to generate the plots.  Enter values
such as BLACK, YELLOW, RED, GREEN, or BLUE.  Programs GAUSS, PATCHI, POINT2,
and STRIPI require the file glq.pts which contains normalized roots and weights
of the Legendre polynominals.  This file is included in the bin_data directory
and script programs are provided to facilitate connection of each program
with the glq.pts file.


H. TESTING

Test data sets are provided to verify that the program is correctly installed
and running on the system.  The tests may also be looked at as examples of how
to use the program.  The directory "analgwst.1/test" contains the scripts to
run the tests.  The directory "analgwst.1/data" contains the input data and
expected results for each test.  Tests are usually run in the directory
analgwst.1/test, but they can be run in any user directory if the installation
procedure was completed (make install performed).  Run the tests using any of
the commands in the table below.  To test the installation, change to the
analgwst.1/test directory and type the command:
      ./test.sh [m [n]]

If running from another directory, specify the full path to the script; for
example:
      /usr/opt/wrdapp/ncalc_2.6/test/test.sh [m [n]]

where:
     m = the number of the first test to perform, default=1
     n = the number of the last test to perform, default=12

For example:

command                         what happens
------------------      ------------------------------------
./test.sh               runs all of the tests
./test.sh n             runs test 'n' through the last test
./test.sh n m           runs test 'n' through 'm'

After the tests are completed, the results are compared to the expected
results.  If all goes well, the only differences will be due to different
processing times or pathnames.  To clean up after the tests, type the
command:
      ./clean.sh

NOTE: the standard data sets were created on a Data General AViiON workstation.
You may notice slight numeric differences in the results on other computers.
These are generally due to different round-off algorithms and the different
architecture of the central processing unit chip.

The tests are described in the table below.  Test is the test number, program
is the program used to run the test, and the usage column indicates how a file
is used, with i for input, o for output, and i/o for both input and output.
